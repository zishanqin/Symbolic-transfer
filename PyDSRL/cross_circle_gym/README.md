Simple game as presented in *Towards Deep Symbolic Reinforcement Learning* (Garnelo et al, 2016).

Consists of the agent (plus) and objects on a field (crosses and circles). Encountering a cross gives reward of +1, encountering a circle gives reward -1 and ends the game.

Environments:

    CrossCircle-NegGrid-v0
    CrossCircle-MixedGrid-v0
    CrossCircle-NegRand-v0
    CrossCircle-MixedRand-v0
    
Innovated new environments:
    
    TestCrossCircle-MixedGrid-v0
